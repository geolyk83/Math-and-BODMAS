# Math-and-BODMAS
Our program will randomly set an arithmetic question for us to answer. If we get the answer wrong, the program will display the correct answer and ask if we want to try a new question. If we get it correct, the program will compliment us and ask if we want a new question. In addition, the program will keep track of our scores and save the scores in an external text file.
